<div class="blockquot"><p>... The career of The Leader remains
one of the mysteries of history. This man,
illegitimate and uneducated, hysterical and
superstitious, gathered about him a
crowded following of those who had been
discontented, but whom he turned into
fanatics. Apparently by pure force of personality
he seized without resistance the
government of one of the world's great
nations. So much is unlikely enough. But
as the ruler of a civilized country he imposed
upon its people the absolute despotism
of a primitive sultanate. He honeycombed
its society with spies. He imprisoned,
tortured, and executed without
trial or check. And while all this went
on he received the most impassioned loyalty
of his subjects! Morality was abandoned
at his command with as much
alacrity as common sense. He himself was
subject to the grossest superstitions. He
listened to astrologers and fortunetellers&mdash;and
executed them when they foretold
disaster. But it is not enough to be amazed
at the man himself. The great mystery is
that people of the Twentieth Century,
trained in science and technically advanced,
should join in this orgy of what
seems mere madness ...</p>

<p>Letter from Professor Albrecht

Herr General Johann von Steppberg,
retired.</p>

<p>My dear General von Steppberg:</p>

<p>It is with reluctance that I intrude
upon your retirement, but at the request
of the Government I have undertaken
a scientific examination of
the causes which brought about The
Leader's rise to power, the extraordinary
popularity of his regime, the
impassioned loyalty he was able to
evoke, and the astounding final developments.</p>

<p>If you can communicate to me any
memories of The Leader which may
aid in understanding this most bewildering
period of our history, I
assure you that it will be appreciated
by myself, by the authorities who
wish the investigation made, and I
dare to hope by posterity.</p>

<p>Letter from General Johann von
Steppberg (Retired) to Professor
Albrecht Aigen, University of Brunn.</p>

<p>Herr Professor:</p>

<p>The official yearbooks of the army
contain the record of my military career.
I have nothing to add to that
information. You say the authorities
wish more. I refuse it. If they threaten
my pension, I will renounce it. If
they propose other pressures, I will
leave the country. In short, I refuse
to discuss in any manner the subject
of your recent communication.</p>

<p>Letter from Professor Albrecht
Aigen to Dr. Karl Thurn, Professor
of Psychology at University of
Laibach.</p>

<p>My dear Karl:</p>

<p>I hope your psionic research goes
better than my official project! My
business goes nowhere! I have written
to generals, ministers, and all
kinds of persons who held high office
under The Leader. Each and every
one refuses to discuss The Leader or
his own experiences under him.
Why? Surely no one would blame
them now! We have had to agree to
pretend that no one did anything
improper under The Leader, or else
that what anyone did was proper at
the time. So why should the nabobs
of that incredible period refuse to
discuss what they should know better
than anyone else? I am almost reduced
to asking the aid of the astrologers
and soothsayers The Leader
listened to. Actually, I must make a
note to do so in sober earnest. At
least they had their own viewpoint
of events.</p>

<p>Speaking of viewpoints, I have had
some hope of clarifying The Leader's
career by comparing it with that
of Prime Minister Winston, in power
in his country when The Leader
ruled ours. His career is splendidly
documented. There is astonishingly
little documentation about The Leader
as a person, however. That is one
of the difficulties of my task. Even
worse, those who should know him
best lock their lips while those&mdash;</p>

<p>Here is an unsolicited letter from
the janitor of a building in which a
former Minister of Education now
has his law offices. I have many letters
equally preposterous....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Enclosure in letter to Dr. Karl
Thurn, University of Laibach.</p>

<p>Herr Professor:</p>

<p>I am the janitor of the building in
which Herr Former Minister of Education
Werfen has his offices. In
cleaning there I saw a letter crumpled
into a ball and thrown into a
corner. I learned in the time of The
Leader that angry actions often mean
evil intentions, so I read the letter to
see if the police should be notified. It
was a letter from you in which you
asked Herr Former Minister of Education
Werfen for his memories of
The Leader.</p>

<p>I remember The Leader, Herr
Professor. He was the most holy man
who ever lived, if indeed he was only
a man. Once I passed the open door
of an office in the building I then
worked in. I looked in the door&mdash;it
was the office of the then-struggling
Party The Leader had founded&mdash;and
I saw The Leader sitting in a chair,
thinking. There was golden light
about his head, Herr Professor. I
have told this to other people and
they do not believe me. There were
shadowy other beings in the room. I
saw, very faintly, great white wings.
But the other beings were still because
The Leader was thinking and
did not wish to be disturbed. I assure
you that this is true, Herr Professor.
The Leader was the holiest of
men&mdash;if he was only a man.</p>

<p class="author">I am most respectfully, Herr Professor, (Et cetera.)</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Letter from Fraulein Lise Grauer,
nurse, in the city of Bludenz, to Professor
Aigen at Brunn University.</p>

<p>Most respected Herr Professor:</p>

<p>I write this at the request of the
Herr Former Police Inspector Grieg,
to whom you directed a letter shortly
before his death. The Herr Former
Police Inspector had been ill for some
time. I was his nurse. I had cared for
him for months and did many small
services for him, such as writing letters
at his direction.</p>

<p>When your letter came he read it
and went into a black mood of deep
and bitter recollection. He would not
speak for hours, and I had great difficulty
in getting him to take his medicines.
Just before his bedtime he
called me and said sardonically;</p>

<p>"Lise, write to this Herr Professor
for me. Say to him that I was once a
decent man. When The Leader took
power, I received orders that I would
not accept. I submitted my resignation.
Then I received orders to come
to The Leader. I obeyed these orders
because my resignation was not yet
accepted. I was received in his office.
I entered it with respect and defiance&mdash;respect
because he was admitted to
be the ruler of our nation; defiance
because I would not obey such orders
as had been sent me in his name.</p>

<p>"The Leader spoke to me, kindly,
and as he spoke all my views changed.
It suddenly seemed that I had
been absurd to refuse the orders sent
me. They seemed right and reasonable
and even more lenient than
would have been justified.... I left
The Leader in a state in which I
could not possibly fail to do anything
he wished. From that moment I
obeyed his orders. I was promoted.
Eventually, as you know, I was in
command of the Neusatz prison
camp. And you know what orders I
carried out there!"</p>

<p>I wept, Herr Professor, because
the Herr Grieg's eyes were terrible
to look at. He was a gentle and kindly
man, Herr Professor! I was his
nurse, and he was a good patient and
a good man in every way. I had
heard of the things that were done
at Neusatz, but I could not believe
that my patient had commanded
them. Now, in his eyes I saw that he
remembered them and that the memory
was intolerable. He said very bitterly:</p>

<p>"Tell the Herr Professor that I can
tell him nothing more. I have no other
memories that would be of service
to him. I have resolved, anyhow, to
get rid even of these. I have kept
them too long. Say to him that his
letter has decided me."</p>

<p>I did not understand what he
meant, Herr Professor. I helped him
prepare for the night, and when he
seemed to be resting quietly I retired,
myself. I was wakened by a very loud
noise. I went to see what was the
matter. The Herr Former Police Inspector
Grieg had managed to get out
of his bed and across the room to a
bureau. He opened a drawer and
took out a revolver. He made his
way back to his bed. He blew out his
brains.</p>

<p>I called the police, and after investigation
they instructed me to
carry out his request, which I do.</p>

<p>Herr Professor, I do not myself
remember the times of The Leader,
but they must have been very terrible.
If the Herr Former Police Inspector
Grieg was actually in command of
the Neusatz prison camp, and did
actually order the things done there,&mdash;I
cannot understand it, Herr Professor!
Because he was a good and
kindly man! If you write of him, I
beg that you will mention that he
was a most amiable man. I was only
his nurse, but I assure you&mdash;(Et

<p>Letter from Dr. Karl Thurn, University
of Laibach, to Professor Albrecht
Aigen, University of Brunn.</p>

<p>My dear friend:</p>

<p>I could have predicted your failure
to secure co-operation from eminent
figures in The Leader's regime. So
long as they keep silent, together,
they can pretend to be respectable.
And nobody longs so passionately to
be respectable as a man who has
prospered by being a swine, while he
awaits an opportunity to prosper
again by more swinishness. I would
advise you to expect your best information
from little people who suffered
most and most helplessly looked
on or helped while enormities were
committed. Such little people will
either yearn over the past like your
janitor, or want most passionately to
understand so that nothing of the sort
can ever happen again.</p>

<p>Winston as a parallel to The Leader?
Or as a contrast? Which? I can
name one marked contrast. I doubt
that anybody really and passionately
wishes that Winston had never been
born.</p>

<p>You mention my researches. You
should see some of our results! I
have found a rat with undeniable
psychokinetic power. I have seen him
move a gram-weight of cheese nearly
three centimeters to where he could
reach it through the cage bars. I begin
to suspect a certain female dog
of abilities I would prefer not to
name just yet. If you can find any
excuse to come to Laibach, I promise
you amazing demonstrations of psi
phenomena. (Et cetera.)</p>

the Earl of Humber, formerly Prime
Minister Winston</i>," by the Hon.
Charles Wilberforce.</p>

<p>Page 231; "... This incredible
event took place even while it seemed
most impossible. The Prime Minister
took it with his usual aplomb. I asked
him what he thought of the matter
a week later, at a house party in
Hertfordshire. He said, 'I consider it
most unfortunate. This Leader of
theirs is an inherently nasty individual.
Therefore he'll make nastiness
the avenue to distinction so long as
he's in power. The results will be
tragic, because when you bottle up
decency men seem to go mad. What
a pity one can't bottle up nastiness!
The world might become a fit place
to live in!'"</p>

<p>Page 247; "The Prime Minister
disagreed. 'There was Napoleon,' he
observed. 'You might despise him,
but after he talked to you you served
him. He seemed to throw a spell
over people. Alexander probably had
the same sort of magic personality.
When his personality ceased to operate,
as a result of too much wine
too continuously, his empire fell immediately
to pieces. I've known others
personally; an Afghan whom I've
always thought did us a favor by
getting killed by a sniper. He could
have caused a great deal of trouble.
I'd guess at the Khalifa. Most of the
people who have this incredible persuasiveness,
however, seem to set up
as successful swindlers. What a pity
The Leader had no taste for simple
crime, and had to go in for crimes of
such elaboration!'"</p>

<p>Letter from Professor Albrecht
Aigen, University of Brunn, to Dr.
Karl Thurn, University of Laibach.</p>

<p>My dear Karl:</p>

<p>You make me curious with your
talk of a rat which levitates crumbs
of cheese and a she-dog who displays
other psi abilities. I assume that you
have found the experimental conditions
which let psi powers operate
without hindrance. I shall hope some
day to see and conceivably to understand.</p>

<p>My own affairs are in hopeless
confusion. At the moment I am overwhelmed
with material about The
Leader, the value of which I cannot
estimate. Strange! I ask people who
should know what I am commissioned
to discover, and they refuse to answer.
But it becomes known that I
ask, and thousands of little people
write me to volunteer impassioned
details of their experiences while The
Leader ruled. Some are bitter because
they did what they did and felt as
they felt. These seem to believe in
magic or demoniac possession as the
reason they behaved with such conspicuous
insanity. Others gloat over
their deeds, which they recount with
gusto&mdash;and then express pious regret
with no great convincingness. Some
of these accounts nauseate me. But
something utterly abnormal was in
operation, somehow, to cause The
Leader's ascendancy!</p>

<p>I wish I could select the important
data with certainty. Almost anything,
followed up, might reveal the key.
But I do not know what to follow!
I plan to go to Bozen, where the
new monstrous computer has been
set up, and see if there is any way in
which it could categorize my data and
detect a pattern of more than bewildered
and resentful frenzy.</p>

<p>On the way back to Brunn I shall
stop by to talk to you. There is so
much to say! I anticipate much of
value from your detached and analytic
mind. I confess, also, that I am
curious about your research. This
she-dog with psi powers, of which
you give no account ... I am
intrigued.</p>

<p>Letter from Professor Albrecht
Aigen, written from The Mathematical
Institute at Bozen, to Dr. Karl
Thurn, University of Laibach.</p>

<p>My dear Karl:</p>

<p>This is in haste. There is much
agitation among the computer staff at
the Institute. An assistant technician
has been discovered to be able to
predict the answer the computer will
give to problems set up at random.
He is one Hans Schweeringen and it
is unbelievable.</p>

<p>Various numerals are impressed on
the feed-in tape of the computer.
Sections of the tape are chosen at
random by someone who is blindfolded.
They are fed unread into the
computer, together with instructions
to multiply, subtract, extract roots,
et cetera, which are similarly chosen
at random and not known to anyone.
Once in twenty times or so, Schweeringen
predicts the result of this
meaningless computation before the
computer has made it. This is incredible!
The odds are trillions to one
against it! Since nobody knows the
sums or instructions given to the
computer, it cannot be mind-reading
in any form. It must be pure precognition.
Do you wish to talk to him?</p>

<p>He is uneasy at the attention he
attracts, perhaps because his father
was one of The Leader's secretaries
and was executed, it is presumed, for
knowing too much. Telegraph me if
you wish me to try to bring him to
you.</p>

<p>Letter from Professor Albrecht
Aigen, at Brunn University, to Dr.
Karl Thurn, University of Laibach.</p>

<p>My dear Karl:</p>

<p>I have first to thank you for your
warm welcome and to express my
gratitude for your attention while I
was your guest. Since my return I
have written many inquiries about
Schweeringen's father. There are so
far no replies, but I have some hope
that people who will not tell of their
own experiences may tell about someone
else&mdash;especially someone now
dead. This may be a useful device to
get at least some information from
people who so far have refused any.
Naturally I will pass on to you anything
I learn.</p>

<p>I try to work again upon the task
assigned me&mdash;to investigate the rise
and power of The Leader. I find it
hard to concentrate. My mind goes
back to your laboratory. I am deeply
shaken by my experience there. I had
thought nothing could be more bewildering
than my own work. Consider:
Today I received a letter in
which a man tells me amazedly of the
life he led in a slave-labor camp during
the time of The Leader's rule.
He describes the attempt of another
prisoner to organize a revolt of the
prisoners. While he spoke of the
brutality of the guards and the intolerably
hard labor and the deliberately
insufficient food, they cheered him.
But when he accused The Leader of
having ordered these things&mdash;the
prisoners fell upon him with cries of
fury. They killed him. I had this information
verified. It was true.</p>

<p>I cannot hope for a sane explanation
of such things. But a sane explanation
for my experience seems
even less probable. I am impressed
by your rat who levitates crumbs of
cheese. But I am appalled; I am horrified;
I am stupefied by what I did!
You asked me to wait for you in a
certain laboratory beyond a door. I
entered. I saw a small, fat, mangy
she-dog in a dog-run. She looked at
me and wagged her tail. I thereupon
went to the other end of the laboratory,
opened a box, and took out a
handful of strange objects you later
told me are sweetmeats to a dog. I
gave them to the animal.</p>

<p>Why did I do it? How was it that
I went directly to a box of which I
knew nothing, opened it as a matter
of course, and took out objects I did
not even recognize, to give them to
that unpleasant small beast? How did
I know where to go? Why did I go?
Why should I give those then-meaningless
objects to the dog? It is as if
I were enchanted!</p>

<p>You say that it is a psi phenomenon.
The rat causes small objects to
move. The dog, you say, causes persons
to give it canine candy. I revolt
against the conclusion, which I cannot
reason away. If you are right, we
are at the mercy of our domestic animals!
Dog-lovers are not people who
love dogs, but people who are enslaved
by dogs. Cat-lovers are merely
people who have been seized upon by
cats to support and pet and cater to
them. This is intolerable! I shall fear
all pets from now on! I throw myself
back into my own work to avoid
thinking of it. I&mdash;</p>

<hr style='width: 15%; margin: 1em auto;' />

<p>Later. I did not mail this letter
because an appalling idea occurred
to me. This could bear upon my investigation!
Do you think The
Leader&mdash;No! It could not be! It
would be madness....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Extract from a letter from Dr.
Karl Thurn to Professor Albrecht
Aigen.</p>

<p>... I deplore your reaction. It has
the emotional quality of a reaction to
witchcraft or magic, but psi is not
witchcraft. It is a natural force. No
natural force is either nonexistent or
irresistible. No natural force is invariably
effective. Psi is not irresistible
under all circumstances. It is not
always effective. My rat cannot levitate
cheese-crumbs weighing more
than 1.7 grams. My she-dog could
not make you give her dog-candy
once you were on guard. When you
went again into the laboratory she
looked at you and wagged her tail as
before. You say that you thought of
the box and of opening it, but you
did not. It was not even an effort of
will to refrain.</p>

<p>A lesser will or a lower grade of
personality cannot overwhelm a
greater one. Not ever! Lesser beings
can only urge. The astrologers used
to say that the stars incline, but they
do not compel. The same can be said
of psi&mdash;or of magnetism or gravitation
or what you will. Schweeringen
could not make the computer err
when it had to err too egregiously.
A greater psi ability was needed than
he had. A greater psi power than was
available would have been needed to
make you give the dog candy, once
you were warned.</p>

<p>I do not apply these statements to
your so-called appalling idea. I carefully
refrain from doing so. It is your
research, not mine....</p>

<p>Extract from letter to Professor
Albrecht Aigen from the Herr Friedrich
Holm, supervisor of electrical
maintenance, municipal electrical
service, Untersberg.</p>

<p>Herr Professor:</p>

<p>You have written to ask if I knew
a certain Herr Schweeringen, attached
to The Leader's personal staff during
his regime. I did know such a
person. I was then in charge of electrical
maintenance in The Leader's
various residences. Herr Schweeringen
was officially one of The Leader's
secretaries, but his actual task was to
make predictions for The Leader, like
a soothsayer or a medium. He had a
very remarkable gift. There were
times when it was especially needful
that there be no electrical failures&mdash;when
The Leader was to be in residence,
for example. On such occasions
it was my custom to ask Herr
Schweeringen if there was apt to be
any failure of apparatus under my
care. At least three times he told me
yes. In one case it was an elevator,
in another refrigeration, in a third
a fuse would blow during a State
dinner.</p>

<p>I overhauled the elevator, but it
failed nevertheless. I replaced the
refrigeration motor, and the new
motor failed. In the third case I
changed the fuse to a new and tested
one, and then placed a new, fused
line around the fuse Herr Schweeringen
had said would blow, and placed
a workman beside it. When the fuse
did blow as predicted, my workman
instantly closed the extra-line switch,
so that the lights of the State dinner
barely flickered. But I shudder when
I think of the result if Herr Schweeringen
had not warned me.</p>

<p>He was executed a few days before
the period of confusion began, which
ended as everyone knows. I do not
know the reason for his execution. It
was said, however, that The Leader
executed him personally. This, Herr
Professor, is all that I know of the
matter.</p>

<p>Letter from Herr Theophrastus
Paracelsus Bosche, astrologer, to Professor
Albrecht Aigen, Brunn University.</p>

<p>Most respected Herr Professor:</p>

<p>I am amused that a so-eminent
scientist like yourself should ask information
from a so-despised former
astrologer to The Leader. It is even
more amusing that you ask about a
mere soothsayer&mdash;a man who displayed
an occult gift of prophecy&mdash;whom
you should consider merely one of
the charlatans like myself whom The
Leader consulted, and who are unworthy
of consideration by a scientific
historian. We have no effect upon
history, most respected Herr Professor!
None at all. Oh, none! I am
much diverted.</p>

<p>You ask about the Herr Schweeringen.
He was a predictor, using his
occult gift of second sight to foreknow
events and tell The Leader
about them. You will remember that
The Leader considered himself to
have occult powers of leadership and
decision, and that all occult powers
should contribute to his greatness. At
times of great stress, such as when
The Leader demanded ever-increasing
concessions from other nations on
threat of war, he was especially concerned
that occult predictions promise
him success.</p>

<p>At a certain time the international
tension was greater than ever before.
If The Leader could doubt the rightness
of any of his actions, he doubted
it then. There was great danger of
war. Prime Minister Winston had
said flatly that The Leader must withdraw
his demands or fight. The
Leader was greatly agitated. He demanded
my prediction. I considered
the stars and predicted discreetly that
war would be prevented by some
magnificent achievement by The
Leader. Truly, if he got out of his
then situation it would be a magnificent
achievement. But astrology, of
course, could only indicate it but not
describe what it would be.</p>

<p>The Leader was confident that he
could achieve anything he could imagine,
because he had convinced even
himself that only treason or disloyalty
could cause him to fail in any
matter. He demanded of his generals
what achievement would prevent the
war. They were not encouraging. He
demanded of his civilian political advisers.
They dared not advise him to
retreat. They offered nothing. He demanded
of his occult advisers.</p>

<p>The Herr Schweeringen demanded
of me that I tell him my exact prediction.
His nerves were bad, then, and
he twitched with the strain. Someone
had to describe the great achievement
The Leader would make. It would be
dangerous not to do so. I told him
the prediction, I found his predicament
diverting. He left me, still
twitching and desperately sunk in
thought.</p>

<p>I now tell you exact, objective
facts, Herr Professor, with no interpretation
of my own upon them. The
Herr Schweeringen was closeted with
The Leader. I am told that his face
was shining with confidence when he
went to speak to The Leader. It was
believed among us charlatans that he
considered that he foreknew what
The Leader would do to prevent war
at this time.</p>

<p>Two hours later there were shots
in The Leader's private quarters.
The Leader came out, his eyes glaring,
and ordered Herr Schweeringen's
body removed. He ordered the
execution of the four senior generals
of the General Staff, of the Minister
of Police, and several other persons.
He then went into seclusion, from
which he emerged only briefly to give
orders making the unthinkable retreat
that Prime Minister Winston
had demanded. No one spoke to him
for a week. Confusion began. These
are objective facts. I now add one
small boast.</p>

<p>My discreet prediction had come
true, and it is extremely diverting to
think about it. The Leader had
achieved magnificently. The war was
prevented not only for the moment
but for later times, too. The Leader's
achievement was the destruction of
his regime by destroying the brains
that had made it operate!</p>

<p>It is quite possible that you will
consider this information a lie. That
will be quite droll. However, I am,
most respected Herr Professor, (Et
cetera.)</p>

<p>Letter from Dr. Karl Thurn, University
of Laibach, to Professor Albrecht
Aigen, Brunn University.</p>

<p>My dear friend:</p>

<p>Your information about the elder
Schweeringen received. The information
about his prediction is interesting.
I could wish that it were complete,
but that would seem to be
hopeless. Your question, asked in a
manner suggesting great disturbance,
is another matter. I will answer it as
well as I can, my friend, but please
remember that you asked. I volunteer
nothing. The question of the rise
and power of The Leader is your research,
not mine.</p>

<p>Here is my answer. Years back an
American researcher named Rhine
obtained seemingly conclusive proof
that telepathy took place. Tonight he
would have a "sender," here, attempt
to transmit some item telepathically
to a "receiver," there. Tomorrow
morning he would compare the record
of what the "sender" had attempted
to transmit, with the record
of what the "receiver" considered he
had received. The correspondence
was far greater than chance. He considered
that telepathy was proven.</p>

<p>But then Rhine made tests for precognition.
He secured proof that
some persons could predict with
greater-than-probability frequency
that some particular event, to be determined
by chance, would take place
tomorrow. He secured excellent evidence
for precognition.</p>

<p>Then it was realized that if one
could foresee what dice would read
tomorrow&mdash;dice not yet thrown&mdash;one
should be able to read what a report
would read tomorrow&mdash;a report not
yet written. In short, if one can foreknow
what a comparison will reveal,
telepathy before the comparison is
unproven. In proving precognition,
he had destroyed his evidence for
telepathy.</p>

<p>It appears that something similar
has happened, which our correspondence
has brought out. Young Schweeringen
predicted what a computer
would report from unknown numerals
and instructions. In order for the
computer to match his predictions, it
had to err. It did. Therefore one reasons
that he did not predict what the
computer would produce. The computer
produced what he predicted. In
effect, what appeared to be foreknowledge
was psychokinesis&mdash;the
same phenomenon as the movement
of crumbs of cheese by my rat. One
may strongly suspect that when young
Herr Schweeringen knew in advance
what the computer would say, he actually
knew in advance what he could
make it say. It is possible that one
can consciously know in advance only
what one can unconsciously bring
about. If one can bring about only
minor happenings, one can never
predict great ones.</p>

<p>This is my answer to your question.
I would like very much to know
what the elder Schweeringen predicted
that The Leader would accomplish!</p>

<p>My she-dog has died. We had a
new attendant in the laboratory. He
fed her to excess. She died of it. (Et

<p>Letter from Professor Albrecht
Aigen to Dr. Thurn.</p>

<p>My dear Karl:</p>

<p>I have resolved to dismiss psionic
ability from my investigation into
The Leader's rise to power. This
much I will concede: The Leader
could enslave&mdash;englamour&mdash;enchant
anyone who met him personally. He
did. To a lesser degree, this irresistible
persuasiveness is a characteristic
of many successful swindlers. But he
could not have englamoured the
whole nation. He did not meet
enough persons personally to make
his regime possible, unless he could
cause other persons to apply their
own magnetism to further his ambitions,
and they others and others and
so on&mdash;like an endless series of magnets
magnetized originally from one.
This is not possible. I restrict myself
to normal, plausible hypotheses&mdash;of
which so far I have no faintest trace.</p>

<p>You agree with me, do you not&mdash;that
it was impossible for The Leader
to weave a web of enchantment over
the whole nation by his own psi energies
controlling the psi energies of
others? I would welcome your assurance
that it could not be.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Letter from Professor Albrecht
Aigen to Dr. Karl Thurn.</p>

<p>My dear Karl:</p>

<p>Did you receive my last letter? I
am anxious to have your assurance
that it was impossible that The Leader
could englamour the whole nation
by his psionic gifts.</p>

<p>Letter, Dr. Karl Thurn to Professor
Albrecht Aigen.</p>

<p>... But what have you discovered,
my friend, that you are afraid to
face?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Letter. Professor Albrecht Aigen
to Dr. Karl Thurn.</p>

<p>My dear Karl:</p>

<p>I appeal to you because I have discovered
how nearly our nation and
the whole world escaped horrors beside
which those of The Leader's actual
regime would seem trivial. Give
me reasons, arguments, proofs beyond
question, which I can put into
my report on his career! I must demonstrate
beyond question that psi
ability did not cause his ascendancy!
Help me to contrive a lie which will
keep anyone, ever, from dreaming
that psi ability can be used to seize
a government and a nation. It could
seize the world more terribly....</p>

<p>I cannot express the urgency of
this need! There are others who
possess The Leader's powers in a
lesser degree. They must remain only
swindlers and such, without ambitions
to rule, or they might study
The Leader's career as Napoleon
studied Alexander's. There must be
no hint, anywhere, of the secret I
have discovered. There must be nothing
to lead to the least thought of it!
The Leader could have multiplied his
power ten-thousand-fold! Another
like him must never learn how it
could be done!</p>

<p>I beg your help, Karl! I am shaken.
I am terrified. I wish that I had
not undertaken this research. I wish
it almost as desperately as I wish
that The Leader had never been
born!</p>

<p>Letter from Colonel Sigmund
Knoeller, retired, to Professor Albrecht
Aigen, Brunn University.</p>

<p>Herr Professor:</p>

<p>In response to your authorized request
for information about certain
events; I have the honor to inform
you that at the time you mention I
was Major in command of the Second
Battalion of the 161st Infantry Regiment,
assigned to guard duty about
the residence of The Leader. Actual
guard duty was performed by the
secret police. My battalion merely
provided sentries around the perimeter
of the residence, and at certain
places within.</p>

<p>On August 19th I received a command
to march three companies of
my men into the residence, to receive
orders from The Leader in person.
This command was issued by the
Herr General Breyer, attached to The
Leader as a military aide.</p>

<p>I led my men inside according to
the orders, guided by the orderly who
had brought them. I entered an inner
courtyard. There was disturbance.
People moved about in a disorderly
fashion and chattered agitatedly. This
was astonishing in The Leader's residence.
I marched up to General
Breyer, who stood outside a group
biting his nails. I saluted and said:
"Major Knoeller reporting for orders,
Herr General."</p>

<p>There was then confusion in the
nearby squabbling group. A man
burst out of it and waved his arms at
me. He looked like The Leader. He
cried shrilly:</p>

<p>"Arrest these men! All of them!
Then shoot them!"</p>

<p>I looked at the Herr General
Breyer. He bit his nails. The man
who looked so much like The Leader
foamed at the mouth. But he was not
The Leader. That is, in every respect
he resembled The Leader to whom I
owed loyalty as did everyone. But no
one who was ever in The Leader's
presence failed to know it. There was
a feeling. One knew to the inmost
part of one's soul that he was The
Leader who must be reverenced and
obeyed. But one did not feel that way
about this man, though he resembled
The Leader so strongly.</p>

<p>"Arrest them!" shrilled the man
ferociously. "I command it! I am
The Leader! Shoot them!"</p>

<p>When I still waited for General
Breyer to give me orders, the man
shrieked at the troopers. He commanded
them to kill General Breyer
and all the rest, including me. And
if he had been The Leader they
would have obeyed. But he was not.
So my men stood stiffly at attention,
waiting for my orders or General
Breyer's.</p>

<p>There was now complete silence in
the courtyard. The formerly squabbling
men watched as if astonished.
As if they did not believe their eyes.
But I waited for General Breyer to
give his commands.</p>

<p>The man screamed in a terrible,
frustrated rage. He waved his arms
wildly. He foamed at the mouth and
shrieked at me. I waited for orders
from General Breyer. After a long
time he ceased to bite his nails and
said in a strange voice:</p>

<p>"You had better have this man
placed in confinement, Major Knoeller.
See that he is not injured. Double
all guards and mount machine guns
in case of rioting outside. Dismiss!"</p>

<p>I obeyed my commands. My men
took the struggling, still-shrieking
man and put him in a cell in the
guardhouse. There was a drunken
private there, awaiting court-martial.
He was roused and annoyed when his
new companion shrieked and screamed
and shook the bars of the door.
He kicked the man who looked so
much like The Leader. I then had the
civilian placed in a separate cell, but
he continued to rave incoherently
until I had the regimental surgeon
give him an injection to quiet him.
He sank into drugged sleep with
foam about his lips.</p>

<p>He looked remarkably like The
Leader. I have never seen such a resemblance!
But he was not The
Leader or we would have known
him.</p>

<p>There was no disturbance outside
the residence. The doubled guards
and the mounted machine guns were
not needed.</p>

<p>Letter, with enclosure, from Professor
Albrecht Aigen, Brunn University,
to Dr. Karl Thurn, University
of Laibach.</p>

<p>My dear Karl:</p>

<p>Because of past sharing in my research,
you will realize what the enclosed
means. It is part of the report
of the physicians who examined The
Leader three days after his confinement
in a military prison. He had recovered
much of his self-control. He
spoke with precision. He appeared
even calm, though he was confused
in some matters. The doctors addressed
him as "My Leader" because he
refused to reply otherwise.</p>

<p>(Enclosure)</p>

<p><i>Dr. Kundmann</i>: But, My Leader,
we do not understand what has happened!
You were terribly disturbed.
You were even ... even confused in
your behavior! Can you tell us what
took place?</p>

<p><i>The Leader</i>: I suffered a great danger
and a temporary damage. That
villain Schweeringen&mdash;I shot him.
It was a mistake. I should have had
him worked over&mdash;at length!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Messner</i>: My Leader, will you
be so good as to tell us the nature of
the danger and the damage?</p>

<p><i>The Leader</i>: Schweeringen probably
told someone what he would propose
to me. It was his conviction that
because of my special gifts I could
cause anyone, not only to obey me,
but to pour out to me, directly, his
inmost thoughts and memories. Of
course this is true. The danger was
that of the contact of my mind with
an inferior one. But I allowed
Schweeringen to persuade me that I
should risk even this for the service of
my people. Therefore I contacted the
mind of Prime Minister Winston,
so I could know every scheme and
every plan he might have or know
to exist to injure my people. I intended,
however, to cause him to become
loyal to me&mdash;though I would
later have had him shot. Schweeringen
had betrayed me, though. When
I made contact with Winston's mind,
it was not only inferior, but diseased!
There was a contagion which temporarily
affected the delicate balance of
my intuition. For a short time I
could not know, as ordinarily, what
was best for my people.</p>

<p>(End of Enclosure)</p>

<p>You will see, my dear Karl, what
took place. To you and to me this
explains everything. In the background
of my research and your information
it is clear. Fortunately, The
Leader's mind was unstable. The
strain and shock of so unparalleled
experience as complete knowledge of
another brain's contents destroyed his
rationality. He became insane. Insane,
he no longer had the psi gifts by
which he had seized and degraded
our nation. He ceased to be The
Leader.</p>

<p>But you will see that this must be
hidden! Another monster like The
Leader, or Napoleon&mdash;perhaps even
lesser monsters&mdash;could attempt the
same feat. But they might be less unstable!
They might be able to invade
the mind of any human being, anywhere,
and drain it of any secret or
impress upon it any desire or command,
however revolting. You see,
Karl, why this must never become
known! It must be hidden forever.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Letter from Dr. Karl Thurn, University
of Laibach, to Professor Albrecht
Aigen, Brunn University.</p>

<p>My dear friend:</p>

<p>I am relieved! I feared for your
judgment. I thought that perhaps
overwork and frustration had set up
an anxiety-block to make you cease
your work. But you are quite right.
Your analysis is brilliant. And now
that you have pointed it out, unquestionably
a man with The Leader's
psi powers could force another man's
brain to transmit all its contents to
him.</p>

<p>But consider the consequences!
Consider the conditions of such an
event. One's brain is designed to
work within one's own skull, dealing
with sensory messages and the like.
Very occasionally it acts outside,
shifting crumbs of cheese and confusing
computers&mdash;and securing candy.
But even when one's will controls
outside actions, it does not fuse with
the outside brain or thing. It molds
or moves the recipient mind, but
there is never a sharing of memory.
You have explained why.</p>

<p>Consider what must happen if a
brain of limited power and essentially
emotional operation is linked to
another and more powerful one. Assume
for a moment that my she-dog
had linked her brain to yours, even
momentarily. Do you realize that she
would not have gotten your memories,
much less your power to reason?
She would not even have acquired
your knowledge of the meaning
of words! When a bright light
shines in your eyes, you see nothing
else. When thunder rolls in your
ears, you do not hear the ticking of
a clock. When you suffer pain, you
do not notice a feather's tickle. If
my she-dog had linked her mind to
yours, she would have experienced
something which is knowledge more
firmly fixed and more continuously
known than anything else in your
conscious life. This overwhelmingly
strong conviction would have been
so powerful and so positive that it
would be imprinted&mdash;branded&mdash;burned
into every cell of her brain.
She could never get it out.</p>

<p>But in receiving this overwhelming
experience she would not get
your memories or power to reason or
even your personality. She would
have experienced only your identity.
She would have received only the
conviction that she was yourself! She
would have been like those poor lunatics
who believe that they are
Napoleon, though they have nothing
of Napoleon in them but the conviction
of identity. They do not know
when he was born or have more than
the vaguest notion of what he did,
but they try to act as who he was&mdash;according
to their own ideas of how
Napoleon would act in their situation.
This is how my she-dog would
have behaved.</p>

<p>I am relieved. You have explained
everything. Your letter gave me the
suspicion. I secured a transcript of
the Herr Doctor's report for myself.
My suspicion became a certainty. You
will find the clue in the report. Consider:
The Leader had had the experience
I imagined for my she-dog.
He had linked his mind with a
stronger one and a greater personality&mdash;if
it must be said, a greater man.
For a moment The Leader knew
what that man knew most certainly,
with most profound conviction, with
most positive knowledge. It was
burned into his brain. He could never
get it out. He did not secure that
other man's memories or knowledge
or ability. He was blinded, deafened,
dazed by the overwhelming conviction
that, the other man had of his
own identity. It would not be possible
for him to get anything else from
a stronger mind and a greater person.
Nor could anyone else succeed where
he failed, my friend! There is no
danger of any man seizing the world
by seizing the minds of all his fellows!
One who tries will meet the
fate of The Leader.</p>

<p>You realize what that fate was, of
course. He suddenly ceased to be the
monster who could cast a spell of
blind adoration for himself. He
ceased to be The Leader! So the
doctors gave him truth-serum so
he would not try to conceal anything
from them. The result is in the
transcript on the third page beyond
the place you quoted to me. There
the doctors asked The Leader who he
was. Read his answer, my friend! It
proves everything! He said:</p>

<p>"I am Prime Minister Winston."</p>
